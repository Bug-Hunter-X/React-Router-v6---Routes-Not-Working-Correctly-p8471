```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ... other routes ... */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
The corrected code includes the `BrowserRouter` component, which correctly wraps the `Routes` component.  This ensures that React Router can manage the routing and correctly render the components based on the URL.  Make sure that you have the latest version of `react-router-dom` installed.  If you are still facing issues after implementing this change, consider checking for other potential problems such as typos in your route paths or conflicts with other libraries.
